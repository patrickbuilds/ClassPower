# ClassPower

Display class specific power info, eg: holy power, combo points, etc.

Currently it uses the games default font, and is colored based on your classes raid color.

## Supported Classes

* Paladin - Displays current amount of Holy Power points.
* Rogue - Displays active combo points on current target.
* Death Knight - Displays number of ready runes.
* Monk - Displays current amount of Chi points.
* Mage - Displays Arcane Charges for Arcane Mages.
* Druid - Displays active combo points on current target.
* Warlock - Displays number of avaliable soul shards.

## Issues, Missing Points

Utilize the issue tracker for bugs. If I'm missing a classes point system let me know. I'm currently not interested in adding resource based items (mana, energy, runic power, astral power, etc) to the output. Mostly because these items are handled by almost every unit frame addon.
